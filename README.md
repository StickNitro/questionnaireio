## Troubleshooting

So, you're in trouble huh? Ok, well let's see if we can get you some help.

The best place to ask questions is on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/questionnaireio). You can also join [our Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/onitro/shared_invite/enQtNjIwMzc0NzE2NTQ0LTQyMGNlYjdhNzkzY2I0ZWM0ZTI5MDMxOTc0ZGNmMDEwZThjZGU3YzE3ZjAzODU5YmNlYmIwMjY1NGRkOTNlMGU) and link your StackOverflow questions there. But try to avoid asking generic help questions directly on Slack since they can easily get lost in the chat. You can also try [searching among the existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/StickNitro/questionnaireio/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue).

Still having trouble? None of the above helped? Hmm, maybe you had better open a [new issue](https://github.com/StickNitro/questionnaireio/issues/new/choose).
